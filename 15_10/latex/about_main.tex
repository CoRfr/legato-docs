Legato\textquotesingle{}s goal is to simplify Io\+T development. We\textquotesingle{}re hoping you\textquotesingle{}ll find the dev environment and app framework so easy to use, you won\textquotesingle{}t need the docs too much. But when you do need to refer to the docs, this info might be useful\+:

\subsection*{Conventions}

We have a less is more approach to docs\textquotesingle{} conventions. We abbreviate, use contractions, and focus on key words. Our formatting is clean and simple. Our language is informal and direct.

\subsection*{Finding Stuff}

We use Doxygen for our reference documentation. Some features, like searching, aren\textquotesingle{}t as robust as we\textquotesingle{}d like.

Here are some \hyperlink{aboutDocsSearch}{Search} tips.

Here\textquotesingle{}s how to find \hyperlink{aboutDocsVersion}{old versions} of the docs.





Copyright (C) Sierra Wireless Inc. Use of this work is subject to license. \hypertarget{aboutDocsSearch}{}\subsection{Search}\label{aboutDocsSearch}
We\textquotesingle{}re using the built-\/in Doxygen search along with browser features and P\+D\+F versions to provide more complete search and navigation capabilities.

\subsubsection*{upper right search box}

This is the default search. Enter keyword, or first few characters, to get a list of corresponding page titles and function names. Click the search icon arrow to display available filter options. Only available in the online version at \href{http://www.legato.io/legato-docs/}{\tt legato.\+io}.

\subsubsection*{on a page}

Like in any browser, use {\ttfamily C\+T\+R\+L+\+F} to search on the current page (topic) displayed.

\subsubsection*{Google search}

You can enter your search in Google. Use simple searches like a {\ttfamily \mbox{[}keyword\mbox{]} Legato} or precise queries like {\ttfamily  site\+:legato.\+io 15\+\_\+01 le\+\_\+sms}.

\subsubsection*{browser back button}

Use your browser\textquotesingle{}s built-\/in navigation features. Click the back button for breadcrumb path; right-\/click the back/forward buttons to pick from a drop-\/down list.

\subsubsection*{P\+D\+F versions}

In any Legato P\+D\+F version, use {\ttfamily C\+T\+R\+L+\+F} for full keyword searches.
